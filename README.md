# Custom Kickstart Neovim Configuration

This is a fork of kickstart.nvim. I’ve updated the preconfigured plugins and settings to suit my needs. Feel free to use this however you like!

## Note
Configuring JDTLS to work flawlessly with Neovim is almost impossible (in my opinion). This is as far as I’ve gotten. LspLog will still show errors, but everything works. I’ll figure out how to configure everything properly eventually.
