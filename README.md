# Custom kickstart neovim configuration

This is a fork of *kickstart.nvim*, I've updated the preconfigured plugins and settings to my needs. Feel free to use this however!

### Note
Configuring JDTLS to work with Neovim is almost impossible (in my opinion), and this is as far as I got. LspLog will still show errors but everything still works, I'll figure out how to configure everything properly eventually.
